# Treasury Contract

Central contract for managing protocol fees and slashed funds with multi-signature withdrawal support.

## Overview

- **Receive and store protocol fees** — Admin or authorized depositors credit fees (e.g. early exit penalties) with a source tag.
- **Slashed fund tracking** — Slashed amounts are credited with source `SlashedFunds` for reporting and distribution.
- **Multi-sig withdrawals** — Withdrawals require a proposal plus a configurable number of signer approvals before execution.
- **Fund source tracking** — Balances are tracked by source (`ProtocolFee`, `SlashedFunds`) for accounting.

## Initialization

- `initialize(admin)` — Sets the admin. Must be called once. Admin can add/remove depositors and signers and set the approval threshold.

## Deposits

- **receive_fee(from, amount, source)**  
  Credits the treasury. Caller must be the admin or an authorized depositor (e.g. bond contract).  
  `source` is either `ProtocolFee` or `SlashedFunds`.  
  Emits `treasury_deposit`.

- **add_depositor(depositor)** — Admin only. Allows the address to call `receive_fee`.
- **remove_depositor(depositor)** — Admin only.

## Multi-sig withdrawals

- **add_signer(signer)** — Admin only. Adds a signer.
- **remove_signer(signer)** — Admin only. Threshold is reduced if it exceeded the new signer count.
- **set_threshold(threshold)** — Admin only. Threshold must be ≤ number of signers.

- **propose_withdrawal(proposer, recipient, amount)**  
  Creates a withdrawal proposal. Only a signer can propose. Amount must be positive and ≤ treasury balance.  
  Sets `expires_at = proposed_at + ttl` (default TTL is 7 days).  
  Emits `treasury_withdrawal_proposed`.

- **approve_withdrawal(approver, proposal_id)**  
  Adds the signer’s approval. Double approval by the same signer is a no-op.  
  Rejects with `ProposalExpired` + emits `treasury_proposal_expired` if `now >= expires_at`.  
  Emits `treasury_withdrawal_approved`.

- **execute_withdrawal(proposal_id, min_amount_out)**  
  Callable by anyone once approval count ≥ threshold. Deducts from treasury and marks the proposal executed.  
  Rejects with `ProposalExpired` + emits `treasury_proposal_expired` if `now >= expires_at`.  
  
  **Withdrawal Guardrails:**
  - **Liquidity Floor**: Ensures remaining balance after withdrawal is ≥ `min_liquidity`. Reverts with "liquidity guard: withdrawal would breach minimum liquidity floor" if violated.
  - **Slippage Protection**: Requires proposal amount ≥ `min_amount_out`. Reverts with "slippage: received amount below minimum" if violated. Pass `0` to skip this check.
  
  Emits `treasury_withdrawal_executed` with `(recipient, min_amount_out, actual_amount)`.

## Queries

- **get_balance()** — Total treasury balance.
- **get_balance_by_source(source)** — Balance attributed to `ProtocolFee` or `SlashedFunds` (cumulative received from that source).
- **get_min_liquidity()** — Current minimum liquidity floor that must remain after withdrawals.
- **set_min_liquidity(admin, min_liquidity)** — Admin only. Sets the minimum balance that must remain in the treasury after any withdrawal.
- **set_proposal_ttl(admin, ttl)** — Admin only. Sets the proposal time-to-live in ledger seconds (default 7 days; pass `0` for no expiry).
- **get_proposal_ttl()** — Current proposal TTL in ledger seconds.
- **get_admin()** — Admin address.
- **is_depositor(address)** — Whether the address can call `receive_fee`.
- **is_signer(address)** — Whether the address can propose and approve withdrawals.
- **get_threshold()** — Required number of approvals to execute.
- **get_proposal(proposal_id)** — Proposal details (recipient, amount, proposer, proposed_at, expires_at, executed).
- **get_approval_count(proposal_id)** — Current number of approvals.
- **has_approved(proposal_id, signer)** — Whether the signer has approved the proposal.

## Events

- **treasury_initialized** — (admin)
- **treasury_deposit** — (from, amount, source)
- **depositor_added** / **depositor_removed** — (depositor)
- **signer_added** / **signer_removed** — (signer)
- **threshold_updated** — (threshold)
- **treasury_withdrawal_proposed** — (proposal_id, recipient, amount, proposer)
- **treasury_withdrawal_approved** — (proposal_id, approver)
- **treasury_withdrawal_executed** — (proposal_id, recipient, amount)
- **treasury_proposal_expired** — (proposal_id)
- **proposal_ttl_updated** — (ttl)

## Per-source accounting identity

Every `execute_withdrawal` call splits the deducted amount proportionally across
`ProtocolFee` and `SlashedFunds` using integer division (`source * withdrawal / total`),
with the remainder assigned to `SlashedFunds`:

```
protocol_deduction = ProtocolFee_balance * actual_amount / TotalBalance   (floor division)
slashed_deduction  = actual_amount - protocol_deduction
```

The following invariant **must hold after every withdrawal**:

```
BalanceBySource(ProtocolFee) + BalanceBySource(SlashedFunds) == TotalBalance
```

Both per-source balances are always non-negative.

**Rounding behaviour**: floor division means `protocol_deduction` may be slightly
less than the ideal proportional share. `slashed_deduction = actual_amount - protocol_deduction`
absorbs the rounding so the total deduction is always **exactly** `actual_amount` — never
more, never less. Because of this, the identity `protocol + slashed == total` holds without
drift after every withdrawal. When `actual_amount == TotalBalance` (full drain), the shortcut
`protocol_deduction = ProtocolFee_balance` is used, guaranteeing both balances reach zero
simultaneously.

These invariants are verified by property tests in `test_proportional_deduction_invariants.rs`
across random deposit/withdrawal sequences (50 proptest cases with up to 20 actions each).

## Security

- Only admin or authorized depositors can credit the treasury.
- Withdrawals require a proposal and at least `threshold` signer approvals.
- Threshold cannot exceed signer count; removing signers auto-caps threshold.
- Amounts use checked arithmetic to avoid overflow/underflow.
- Proposal execution is idempotent (executed flag prevents double spend).
- Proposals expire after the configured TTL (default 7 days); approvals and execution are rejected once expired.
- **Liquidity Floor Guardrail**: `min_liquidity` setting ensures treasury maintains minimum solvency after withdrawals.
- **Slippage Protection**: `min_amount_out` parameter protects withdrawal executors from unfavorable settlement conditions.

## Emergency rescue

- **rescue_native(admin, to, amount)**  
  Admin-only. Transfers *excess* tokens — those held by the contract beyond the internally accounted `TotalBalance` — to `to`.  
  This allows recovery of accidentally sent or airdropped tokens without touching user/protocol funds.

  **Excess-only bound**:
  ```
  excess = token_client.balance(contract) - TotalBalance
  ```
  `amount` must satisfy `0 < amount ≤ excess`. Any attempt to rescue accounted funds reverts with `InsufficientTreasuryBalance (#602)`.  
  Emits `native_rescued` with `(to, amount, admin)` only after a successful transfer.
